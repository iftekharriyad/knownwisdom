Known Wisdom is a group of professionals who want to use their skills to improve this world. For this our focus is helping others to make this a more sustainable world and improve the environment. 

“We are not environmentalists, we are professionals who care about the environment.”

We help other nonprofits maximize their use of technology and digital services to expand their exposure to the community and donors alike. Known Wisdom does this in the most effective way by leveraging valuable services from digital market leaders such as Microsoft, Google, Salesforce and others. We consult with our clients to understand their needs, and implement digital strategies to help reach their goals.

Our experience is that many non profit organizations have difficulty with their IT work. For this, we would like to help through our services.

Ultimately, we want to extend in the future our support outside of the area of IT. We believe that virtually every professional skill can be used to make this a better world.




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Script

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
